Hello,
This is an attemp to detect the
beats of the music currently being
played in Android System.

Currently I am flashing Android's Camera to represent the beats detected.
Note, this is not perfect, and infact par from that.

You can load the music mp3 files in raw folder in assets, And change the file name in MainActivity.java accordingly.
